# EAI Work Tool - Sub-Agent Delegation Framework

## Overview
This document establishes the framework for delegating implementation tasks to sub-agents, including Rovodev, for the EAI Work Tool enterprise messaging protocol extension.

## Delegation Principles

### 1. Role-Based Delegation
- **Human Developers**: Complex logic, architecture decisions, quality assurance
- **Rovodev**: Code generation, testing, documentation
- **Other Sub-Agents**: Specialized tasks as needed

### 2. Task Categorization
- **Creative Tasks**: Architecture design, UX decisions (Human)
- **Repetitive Tasks**: Code generation, testing (Sub-agents)
- **Review Tasks**: Code review, quality assurance (Human)

### 3. Collaboration Model
- Sub-agents generate initial implementations
- Human developers review and refine
- Iterative improvement through feedback loops

## Session-Based Delegation

### PM Sessions
Managed by human project managers with support from sub-agents for:
- Progress tracking reports
- Resource allocation analysis
- Risk assessment documentation

### Feature Implementation Sessions
Managed by human technical leads with support from sub-agents for:
- Code generation
- Test framework creation
- Documentation drafting

## Protocol-Specific Delegation

### WSDL Protocol (feature/wsdl-implementation)
**Rovodev Tasks**:
- Generate enhanced WSDLProtocol class methods
- Create complex type definition handlers
- Generate unit test templates
- Create documentation for WSDL features

**Human Developer Tasks**:
- Design complex type handling architecture
- Implement service and port type management
- Review and refine Rovodev-generated code
- Conduct security and performance testing

### SOAP Protocol (feature/soap-implementation)
**Rovodev Tasks**:
- Generate SOAPProtocol class implementation
- Create SOAP envelope builders
- Generate SOAP message validation functions
- Create SOAP testing scenarios

**Human Developer Tasks**:
- Design SOAP message structure
- Implement security features (WS-Security)
- Optimize performance for large messages
- Integrate with WSDL generation

### XSD Protocol (feature/xsd-implementation)
**Rovodev Tasks**:
- Generate XSDProtocol class methods
- Create schema validation functions
- Generate XSD element builders
- Create XSD documentation

**Human Developer Tasks**:
- Design schema complexity handling
- Implement cross-schema references
- Optimize validation performance
- Ensure compatibility with WSDL

### JSON-RPC Protocol (feature/jsonrpc-implementation)
**Rovodev Tasks**:
- Generate JSONRPCProtocol class
- Create request/response handlers
- Generate batch processing functions
- Create JSON-RPC test cases

**Human Developer Tasks**:
- Design error handling patterns
- Implement security measures
- Optimize serialization performance
- Ensure cross-protocol compatibility

### SAP Protocol (feature/sap-implementation)
**Rovodev Tasks**:
- Generate SAPProtocol class structure
- Create RFC function call builders
- Generate IDoc processors
- Create SAP integration documentation

**Human Developer Tasks**:
- Design SAP-specific data handling
- Implement security protocols
- Optimize for SAP system integration
- Handle SAP-specific error cases

## Communication Protocol

### Task Assignment
1. Human developer creates task in session manager
2. Task is assigned to appropriate sub-agent
3. Sub-agent works on task
4. Results are reviewed by human developer

### Progress Reporting
1. Daily automated progress reports
2. Weekly milestone summaries
3. Immediate blocker notifications
4. Quality metrics tracking

### Feedback Loop
1. Human developer provides feedback on sub-agent output
2. Sub-agent incorporates feedback in next iteration
3. Continuous improvement process
4. Knowledge transfer documentation

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Code Generation Standards
- Follow existing code style guidelines
- Include comprehensive comments
- Generate testable code
- Maintain consistency across protocols

### Review Process
1. Sub-agent generates implementation
2. Human developer reviews for quality
3. Automated tests are run
4. Security and performance checks
5. Code is merged after approval

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all generated functions
- Integration tests for protocol features
- Performance benchmarks
- Security vulnerability scans

## Monitoring and Evaluation

### Success Metrics
- Code quality scores (maintainability, readability)
- Test coverage percentages (>85%)
- Performance benchmarks (generation time <2s)
- Security compliance (zero critical vulnerabilities)
- User satisfaction scores (>4.5/5)

### Progress Tracking
- Git commit frequency and quality
- Issue resolution time
- Feature completion rate
- Bug report frequency and severity

### Resource Utilization
- Sub-agent efficiency metrics
- Human developer productivity
- Infrastructure resource usage
- Cost-effectiveness analysis

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- Protocol complexity exceeding capabilities
- Performance issues with large datasets
- Compatibility problems between protocols
- Security vulnerabilities in generated code

### Mitigation Strategies
- Incremental implementation approach
- Regular performance testing
- Comprehensive validation against specifications
- Security-focused code review process

### Contingency Plans
- Fallback to manual implementation for complex features
- Alternative protocols for specific use cases
- Additional human resources for critical tasks
- Extended timeline for challenging features

## Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Collection
- Developer feedback on sub-agent performance
- User feedback on generated features
- Performance metrics analysis
- Quality audit results

### Process Optimization
- Regular review of delegation effectiveness
- Adjustment of task categorization
- Improvement of communication protocols
- Enhancement of monitoring systems

### Knowledge Management
- Documentation of best practices
- Lessons learned from each session
- Sub-agent performance optimization
- Skill development for human developers
