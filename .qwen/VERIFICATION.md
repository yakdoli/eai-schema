### Key Components Implemented

1. **Protocol Abstraction Layer**
   - BaseProtocol class
   - ProtocolFactory implementation
   - Protocol-specific extensions

2. **Data Models**
   - BaseModel class
   - Protocol-specific model extensions

3. **Utility Classes**
   - ProtocolDetector
   - ValidationUtil
   - ExportUtil

4. **Development Infrastructure**
   - Sandbox testing environment
   - Workflow guidelines
   - Documentation organization

### Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of SOAP protocol
2. Enhance WSDL implementation with advanced features
3. Create UI components for protocol selection
4. Write comprehensive unit tests
