# EAI Work Tool - Sub-Agent Delegation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the delegation plan for implementing the enterprise messaging protocol extension using sub-agents, including Rovodev.

## Feature Branches
1. `feature/wsdl-protocol` - WSDL protocol implementation
2. `feature/soap-protocol` - SOAP protocol implementation
3. `feature/xsd-protocol` - XSD protocol implementation
4. `feature/jsonrpc-protocol` - JSON-RPC protocol implementation
5. `feature/sap-protocol` - SAP RFC/IDoc protocol implementation

## Delegation Strategy

### Rovodev Assignments
Rovodev will be assigned to handle code generation, testing, and documentation tasks:

1. **Protocol Implementation Code Generation**
   - Generate boilerplate code for protocol classes
   - Create data models for each protocol
   - Implement factory pattern extensions

2. **Testing Framework**
   - Generate unit tests for protocol implementations
   - Create integration test templates
   - Set up test data generation

3. **Documentation**
   - Generate API documentation
   - Create user guides for each protocol
   - Update inline code comments

### Human Developer Assignments
Human developers will focus on complex logic, architecture decisions, and quality assurance:

1. **Architecture Design**
   - Protocol interface design
   - Data model relationships
   - Integration with existing codebase

2. **Complex Logic Implementation**
   - Validation algorithms
   - Protocol conversion logic
   - Performance optimization

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Code review
   - Security auditing
   - User experience refinement

## WSDL Protocol Implementation Plan (feature/wsdl-protocol)

### Phase 1: Core Enhancement
- Enhance WSDLProtocol with advanced features
- Implement support for complex type definitions
- Add service and port type management

### Phase 2: UI Components
- Create WSDL-specific configuration panels
- Implement visual representation of WSDL structure
- Add validation feedback components

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
- Write comprehensive unit tests
- Implement validation against WSDL specifications
- Conduct performance testing

## Task Delegation for WSDL Protocol

### Rovodev Tasks
1. Generate enhanced WSDLProtocol class methods
2. Create complex type definition handlers
3. Generate unit test templates
4. Create documentation for WSDL features

### Human Developer Tasks
1. Design complex type handling architecture
2. Implement service and port type management
3. Review and refine Rovodev-generated code
4. Conduct security and performance testing

## Communication Protocol

### Status Updates
- Daily progress reports in team channel
- Weekly milestone reviews
- Immediate notification of blockers

### Code Review Process
1. Rovodev generates code implementation
2. Human developer reviews and refines
3. Automated tests are run
4. Code is merged after approval

## Monitoring and Evaluation

### Success Metrics
- Code quality scores
- Test coverage percentages
- Performance benchmarks
- User feedback ratings

### Progress Tracking
- Git commit frequency
- Issue resolution time
- Feature completion rate
- Bug report frequency

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- Protocol complexity exceeding implementation capabilities
- Performance issues with large WSDL files
- Compatibility problems with different WSDL versions

### Mitigation Strategies
- Incremental implementation approach
- Regular performance testing
- Comprehensive validation against specifications
