# EAI Work Tool - Agent Guidelines

## Project Overview

The EAI Work Tool is a modern React-based Enterprise Application Integration utility for generating XML schemas and data structures. This project is being extended to support multiple enterprise messaging protocols including WSDL, SOAP, XSD, JSON-RPC, and SAP RFC/IDoc.

### Current Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 with JSX
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 with CSS variables
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui styling
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Type Safety**: JSDoc annotations
- **Code Quality**: ESLint configuration

## Architecture Guidelines

```

### Core Design Principles

1. **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of protocol implementations
2. **Protocol Abstraction**: Common base classes for all protocols
3. **Factory Pattern**: Centralized protocol instantiation
4. **Consistent Interfaces**: Uniform API across all protocols
5. **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new protocols
6. **Performance**: Efficient handling of large data structures

## Protocol Implementation Guidelines

### Base Protocol Structure
All protocols must extend the `BaseProtocol` class and implement:
- `validate()` - Input validation
- `generate()` - Protocol-specific generation
- `export()` - Output formatting
- `getSchema()` - Schema definition

### Supported Protocols

#### WSDL (Web Services Description Language)
- XML-based interface definition language
- Describes web services and how to access them
- Defines service endpoints, operations, messages, and data types

#### SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
- Protocol for exchanging structured information
- Uses XML for message format
- Works with various transport protocols (HTTP, SMTP, TCP)

#### XSD (XML Schema Definition)
- Describes structure and constraints of XML documents
- Defines data types, elements, and attributes
- Used for validating XML documents

#### JSON-RPC
- Lightweight remote procedure call protocol
- Uses JSON for data format
- Simple specification with request/response model

#### SAP RFC/IDoc
- SAP's proprietary integration technologies
- RFC for synchronous communication
- IDoc for asynchronous messaging

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow ESLint configuration rules
- Use JSDoc annotations for type safety
- Maintain test coverage above 85%
- Follow React best practices and hooks rules
- Use Tailwind CSS conventions for styling

### Component Development
- Use shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- Implement responsive design with dark/light theme support
- Follow component composition patterns
- Maintain accessibility standards

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all protocol implementations
- Integration tests for protocol interactions
- Performance tests for large data structures
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- User acceptance testing
